I'm currently starting my journey in the **DevOps** and **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** field. I had the opportunity to join a highly skilled team, where I'm learning and growing every day through:

- 📚 Studies and certifications (focused on **OCI - Oracle Cloud Infrastructure**)
- 🛠️ Hands-on experience with real-world projects
